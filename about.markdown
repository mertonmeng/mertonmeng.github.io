This is Shang's tech blog. I am a Software Engineer working in Vision and Robotic for many years. This blog focuses on documenting part-time projects and ideas just in case I got stroke (knock on the wood) and didn't get my insurance and have to work again, so that I can pick up my job I am doing now.

All the posts in this blog are not tutorials, and I am happy to hear any suggestion, advice or feedbacks.

You can reach out to me by using twitter or github (not sure how you can do that, but just in case) or being a Sherlock Holmes finding me on Linkedin.
